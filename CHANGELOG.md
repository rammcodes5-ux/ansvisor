## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.3] - 2026-06-14

### Security
- Internal API routes now enforce org/brand ownership on every request — closed a set of IDOR gaps where a `:brandId` / `:id` / `:jobId` in the URL was trusted without checking it belonged to the caller's organization (tracking, content, and volumes routes) (#246)
- Enabled Row Level Security on previously exposed tables: `jobs` and `prompt_volumes` (server-only, no client policy) and `competitors` / `topics` (org-membership-scoped member policies mirroring `content_opportunities`) (#250)
- The on-demand tracking endpoint (`POST /api/tracking/check`) now goes through the same cloud cost guard as `analyze-new` — inactive subscriptions get 402, daily-cap / cooldown get 429 — so it can no longer bypass quota on cloud (#252)
- Cloro callback (`/cloro/callback`) now verifies the webhook signature before processing (#229)
- Aggregate / row-fetch RPCs flipped to `SECURITY INVOKER` so they run with the caller's RLS context instead of the definer's (#200)
- RBAC: write controls on Manage Prompts / Manage Topics are hidden for non-admin/manager roles, and Settings → Agent Save/Remove is gated behind admin (#141, #142)

### Added
- Shopping: end-to-end Shopping suite — brand-level Shopping mode toggle, ChatGPT Shopping platform, normalized `prompt_result_shopping_cards` with a parser worker, sidebar entry + overview page, My Products / Competitors tabs with brand matching, a card-eligible prompts tab, and Insights isolation (#143, #144, #155, #157, #176, #178; #176 and #178 thanks @Pallavikumarimdb)
- Agent: `render_chart` tool with inline Recharts visualizations in the chat panel (#138)
- Content: monthly quota for content brief generation (#224)
- Citations: "Own domain only" filter to isolate first-party citations (#164, thanks @Pallavikumarimdb)
- Auth: password visibility toggle on the auth forms (#210, thanks @MaitreyeeDeshmukh)
- Onboarding: in-app Product Tour button (#225, thanks @gaoharimran29-glitch)
- MCP: `get_ai_traffic` (#148), `get_prompt_volumes` (#160), `list_shopping_cards` / `get_product_visibility` (#177), and prompt-level performance aggregation (#181) tools — each with a parallel REST endpoint (#148, #177, #181 thanks @Pallavikumarimdb)
- Tests: Vitest infrastructure for both `web/` (#202) and `server/` (#249), plus unit tests for the CSV serializer (#219), `classifyDomain` / hostname helpers (#248), and `parseResponse` / `countBrandMentions` (#251) (all thanks @Pallavikumarimdb)
- CI: lint + CI pipeline for the `server/` package (#201, thanks @Pallavikumarimdb)
- DX: seed now populates raw `prompt_results.shopping_cards` so the demo dashboard shows shopping data out of the box (#232)

### Changed
- Plans: server plan limits now read from the same source of truth as the web app, so cloud quotas stay in sync (#223)
- Sidebar: tighter nav-item density (#166), removed the redundant Settings entry (#167), and moved the collapse toggle above the profile row with a restyle (#168)
- Brands: brand list cards slimmed to a nav-menu shape (#154, #156), typography aligned with the Insights page (#179), softened active-card outline (#175), bolder breadcrumb avatar fallback (#174)
- Agent: today's date is injected into the system prompt so time-window queries ("last 7 days") resolve correctly (#137)

### Fixed
- Brands: page no longer crashes — `buttonVariants` is now server-safe (#230)
- Auth: the full reset-password flow is wired end-to-end (#151, #171)
- Insights: show platform totals (#172, thanks @nanookclaw); group results by platform on both the insights and prompt-detail views (#235, #237, thanks @VrtxOmega); CSV export writes platform display names instead of raw slugs (#234); moved the raw results count out of the page header (#238)
- Tracking: cloud snippet points at `api.ansvisor.com` (#218); Shopping sidebar entry is gated by the active brand instead of org-wide (#170, #173)
- Team settings: show the role label instead of the raw enum value (#147, thanks @akagifreeez)
- UI: ChatGPT avatar stays visible in light mode (#162, thanks @nanookclaw); `PasswordInput` merges caller `className` via `cn` (#212, thanks @MaitreyeeDeshmukh); icon-only buttons across the dashboard now have accessible names (a11y) (#253, thanks @BharadwajKanneveti)
- Billing: removed a stray debug log from the Stripe checkout route (#184, thanks @krishnaprasharkp)
- Self-host: Docker Compose image tags sync with the package version (#185, thanks @xianzuyang9-blip)

### Docs
- Added a Code of Conduct (Contributor Covenant) (#247), a backend `server/` README (#188, thanks @titanniya542-spec), and fork instructions in CONTRIBUTING (#135, thanks @ayobamiseun)
- Repo: GitHub issue forms + PR template (#233); README polish — Resources section, single H1 tagline, product-tour badge, banner image, `www` links, and marking the in-product AI assistant as shipped (#165, #197, #207, #214, #215, #216; thanks @beanscg, @n1dhiparate, @xzlknr)

## [0.1.2] - 2026-05-31

### Added
- In-product AI agent: chat panel grounded in the MCP read tools, available on every cloud plan via BYOK — paste your own Anthropic API key in Settings → Agent. Self-host uses `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` from env (#120, #121)
- Settings → Agent: org-level Anthropic API key management for cloud customers; AES-256-GCM encrypted at rest, only `last4` + saver metadata visible to org members, save/clear is admin-only (#121)
- MCP: `generate_content_brief` tool that triggers the brief endpoint (#109)
- MCP: `update_opportunity_status` tool for workflow transitions (#110)
- MCP: `get_competitor_comparison` tool with share-of-voice (#116)
- MCP: `list_citations` tool + REST endpoint (#117)
- MCP: `get_visibility_trend` tool (visibility time-series) + REST endpoint (#118)

### Changed
- Insights: aggregate insights data in Postgres instead of pulling rows into Node — meaningful drops in p95 for orgs with large prompt-result tables (#114)
- Repo: renamed from `aeohub/ansvisor` to `ansvisor/ansvisor`; all internal links + docs updated (#102)
- Marketing: removed the in-app `/pricing` page; canonical pricing lives on `ansvisor.com/pricing`, and `/pricing` on the app redirects there (#119)
- CI: ESLint now runs in CI alongside Prettier and TypeScript (#128, thanks @ayobamiseun); the 8 existing lint errors lurking in the codebase were cleared in the same window so the new check stays green (#133)

### Fixed
- Invite flow: clicks on invite emails now route through a new `/auth/confirm` route handler that does server-side `verifyOtp` and writes the session cookie before the user lands on the accept page. The previous flow ejected invitees to `/sign-up`, where Supabase's silent duplicate-signup obfuscation left them with no password set; the accept card now also asks for a password + full name before joining so the user can sign back in (#127, #129, #130)
- Onboarding: align prompts to the selected plan's engine set on Stripe checkout success — Starter customers no longer see Growth-only platforms after upgrading via the onboarding flow (#111)
- Billing: same alignment runs on every plan-change path (PATCH subscription, webhook, downgrade) so prompts stay consistent with the active plan regardless of which surface fired the change (#112)

## [0.1.1] - 2026-05-26

### Added
- MCP server with API keys + `list_brands` and `get_visibility_summary` tools, exposed at `/api/mcp` (#20)

- MCP: `list_content_opportunities` / `get_content_opportunity` tools + REST endpoints (#74)
- Anthropic Skills: Ansvisor AEO Coach ships in two flavours — MCP tool for Claude Desktop / Code / Cursor / Zed, and standalone REST for claude.ai web (#23)
- Analytics: PostHog + Vercel Analytics with self-host opt-in posture (#13)
- Analytics: universal user identification and onboarding-funnel instrumentation (#30)
- CSV export buttons on Topics (#53), Prompts (#54), and Answer Engine Insights (#73)
- Citations: searchable prompt combobox filter (#55)
- Sidebar: user profile chip (avatar + name) linking to settings (#52)

- Tracking: capture Google AI Mode `shoppingCards` into `prompt_results` (#86)
- Tracking: capture Microsoft Copilot `shoppingCards` into `prompt_results` (#87)
- DX: `supabase/seed.sql` ships a populated local dashboard (one demo org, brand, prompts, ~120 prompt results, competitors, content opportunities, AI traffic logs) — `demo@ansvisor.local` / `demo123` (#75)
- Tooling: Prettier configuration + CI workflow (format check & typecheck) (#80)

### Changed

- CI: auto-welcome first-time contributors on PRs only (#34, #59)

### Fixed
- Billing: block tracking + features for orgs without an active subscription (#56)
- Citations: group raw model slugs under display names in the Platforms filter (#48)
- Insights: adaptive Y-axis on the Brand vs Competitors chart (#37)
- Insights: silence navigation-cancellation toast (#70)
- MCP: use the app URL for the MCP endpoint (#33)
- UI: ComboboxTrigger overflow — respect caller width and clip long values (#91)
- Onboarding: preserve pending content opportunities (#63)
- UI: sign-in / sign-up header logo points at the marketing site (#57)
- UI: remove unused dashboard layout header (#36)
- Refresh stale package-lock metadata (#51)
