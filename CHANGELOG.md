## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.2] - 2026-05-31

### Added
- In-product AI agent: chat panel grounded in the MCP read tools, available on every cloud plan via BYOK — paste your own Anthropic API key in Settings → Agent. Self-host uses `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` from env (#120, #121)
- Settings → Agent: org-level Anthropic API key management for cloud customers; AES-256-GCM encrypted at rest, only `last4` + saver metadata visible to org members, save/clear is admin-only (#121)
- MCP: `generate_content_brief` tool that triggers the brief endpoint (#109)
- MCP: `update_opportunity_status` tool for workflow transitions (#110)
- MCP: `get_competitor_comparison` tool with share-of-voice (#116)
- MCP: `list_citations` tool + REST endpoint (#117)
- MCP: `get_visibility_trend` tool (visibility time-series) + REST endpoint (#118)

### Changed
- Insights: aggregate insights data in Postgres instead of pulling rows into Node — meaningful drops in p95 for orgs with large prompt-result tables (#114)
- Repo: renamed from `aeohub/ansvisor` to `ansvisor/ansvisor`; all internal links + docs updated (#102)
- Marketing: removed the in-app `/pricing` page; canonical pricing lives on `ansvisor.com/pricing`, and `/pricing` on the app redirects there (#119)
- CI: ESLint now runs in CI alongside Prettier and TypeScript (#128, thanks @ayobamiseun); the 8 existing lint errors lurking in the codebase were cleared in the same window so the new check stays green (#133)

### Fixed
- Invite flow: clicks on invite emails now route through a new `/auth/confirm` route handler that does server-side `verifyOtp` and writes the session cookie before the user lands on the accept page. The previous flow ejected invitees to `/sign-up`, where Supabase's silent duplicate-signup obfuscation left them with no password set; the accept card now also asks for a password + full name before joining so the user can sign back in (#127, #129, #130)
- Onboarding: align prompts to the selected plan's engine set on Stripe checkout success — Starter customers no longer see Growth-only platforms after upgrading via the onboarding flow (#111)
- Billing: same alignment runs on every plan-change path (PATCH subscription, webhook, downgrade) so prompts stay consistent with the active plan regardless of which surface fired the change (#112)

## [0.1.1] - 2026-05-26

### Added
- MCP server with API keys + `list_brands` and `get_visibility_summary` tools, exposed at `/api/mcp` (#20)
- MCP: `list_prompts` / `get_prompt` and `list_topics` / `get_topic` tools, plus parallel REST endpoints (#35)
- MCP: `list_content_opportunities` / `get_content_opportunity` tools + REST endpoints (#74)
- Anthropic Skills: Ansvisor AEO Coach ships in two flavours — MCP tool for Claude Desktop / Code / Cursor / Zed, and standalone REST for claude.ai web (#23)
- Analytics: PostHog + Vercel Analytics with self-host opt-in posture (#13)
- Analytics: universal user identification and onboarding-funnel instrumentation (#30)
- CSV export buttons on Topics (#53), Prompts (#54), and Answer Engine Insights (#73)
- Citations: searchable prompt combobox filter (#55)
- Sidebar: user profile chip (avatar + name) linking to settings (#52)
- Prompts: Competition column with a 5-bar difficulty meter (#82)
- Tracking: capture Perplexity `shopping_cards` into `prompt_results` (#83)
- Tracking: capture Google AI Mode `shoppingCards` into `prompt_results` (#86)
- Tracking: capture Microsoft Copilot `shoppingCards` into `prompt_results` (#87)
- DX: `supabase/seed.sql` ships a populated local dashboard (one demo org, brand, prompts, ~120 prompt results, competitors, content opportunities, AI traffic logs) — `demo@ansvisor.local` / `demo123` (#75)
- Tooling: Prettier configuration + CI workflow (format check & typecheck) (#80)

### Changed
- README: replaced the intro with a build-in-public manifesto (#90)
- README / docs metadata: tagline updated to "AI Visibility & AI Search Optimization" (#89)
- Docs: rewrote "What is Ansvisor?" around AI Search Visibility / GEO / AEO (#92)
- README: stargazers CTA above "Why Ansvisor?" (#77)
- Onboarding: signout button in the bottom-right corner (#68)
- Settings: contact-us CTA opens the contact page (#81)
- CI: auto-welcome first-time contributors on PRs only (#34, #59)

### Fixed
- Billing: block tracking + features for orgs without an active subscription (#56)
- Citations: group raw model slugs under display names in the Platforms filter (#48)
- Insights: adaptive Y-axis on the Brand vs Competitors chart (#37)
- Insights: silence navigation-cancellation toast (#70)
- MCP: use the app URL for the MCP endpoint (#33)
- UI: ComboboxTrigger overflow — respect caller width and clip long values (#91)
- Onboarding: preserve pending content opportunities (#63)
- UI: sign-in / sign-up header logo points at the marketing site (#57)
- UI: remove unused dashboard layout header (#36)
- Refresh stale package-lock metadata (#51)
