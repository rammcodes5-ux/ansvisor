/**
 * Treat a bare `YYYY-MM-DD` dateTo as end-of-day in UTC. Postgres parses
 * a bare date string as 00:00:00 of that day, so `<= '2026-05-31'`
 * silently excludes everything that happened on May 31 itself. Callers
 * — date pickers, the in-product agent's tools, the MCP REST surface —
 * pass bare dates routinely; this helper expands them to `23:59:59.999Z`
 * so the rest of the day is included.
 *
 * Full ISO timestamps (`2026-05-31T15:30:00Z`) are passed through as-is
 * so callers that want a strict upper bound still get one.
