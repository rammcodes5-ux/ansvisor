 * `canAdmin` is the stricter admin-only gate used by team management
 * and the Settings → Agent API key.
 *
 * The plan-gating equivalent is [`useFeatureGate`](./use-feature-gate.ts).
 * They compose cleanly: feature gate decides "is this product surface
 * available at all?", role gate decides "is this user allowed to write?"
